This is our Final Project in Hardware Design and Lab.  
  
In this project we employed various technique to design a  **paper tape music player** to read data from a encoded paper  
tape by an IR detecting module, and the music is adopted from real world music sheet.    
    
The device is capable of reading multiple tracks and play them out.  
  
Implementation Detail can be referred to the report.
