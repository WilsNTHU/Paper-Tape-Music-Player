This is our Final Project in Hardware Design and Lab.  
  
In this project we employ various technique to design an  
**paper tape music player** to read data from a paper tape  
by IR detecting module, and the music is adopted from  
real world music sheet.  
(*Twinkle_Twinkle_Little_Star* and *beethoven pour elise*)
  
The device is capable of reading multiple tracks and  
play them out. 
  
For interested reader you can refer to the report for  
implementation detail.
